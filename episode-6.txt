A hook is nothing but a normal js function which has it's own usecases.

useEffect hook
syntax
    useEffect(()=>{}, []);

    The callback function is called after your component renders.

    if u want to do something after rendering the component we use it usin useEffect

     //as the data loads to show the loading screen we can render a Loading text like this
    // but this is not a good practice. So we use something called as Shimmer UI to mitigate this.
