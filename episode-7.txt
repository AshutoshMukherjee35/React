if no dependency array that means useEffect is called on every render

if dependency array is empty then useEffect is called on on initial render and just once.

if dependency array is [btnName] then the useeffect is called everytime the btnName changes.

never create your useState hook outside the functional component as it will throw an error. Try to call the hooks on the TOP.

Never use your useState hook inside an if-else statement, for loops, functions.

state variable are meant to be created at the top of the functional component only. This is a best practise to follow.

For routing we use react router dom library

whenever we have to create routes we have to code a routing information

createBrowserRouter , RouterProvider

LINK is used to make redirections in the application, provided by react-router-dom. It is used in place of anchor(<a></a>) tags to make the redirections.
the syntax is <Link to="path"></Link>. Using this the app does not reloads everytime when a redirection takes place.

As the reload does not take place again and again that's why react applications are called as Single page applications.

# There are 2 types of routing :

1. Server Side routing: When there is any network call taking place while loading a page onto the client such a routing is known as server side routing.
for example, if we are using anchor tags to make n/w calls to server to load a specific page then server side routing takes place.

2. Client Side routing: When there's no n/w call taking place for loading the page. This is as the Components are loaded initially
and as per the routing information the components keeps changing. This makes the App faster. React uses client side routing as all the components are loaded in the beginning and 
as per the changes in the routing information the components gets replaced. Making the app faster and also making react app's Single Page Application.
