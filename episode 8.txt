Why do we use Super(props)?

loading a class based component means creating an instance of the class

In class based components we do not update the state variables directly
this.state.count = this.state.count+1 this is invalid way of changing the state.
instead we use this.setState() function. That takes in an object
that modifies your state.

In Class Based Components, When a child component is used inside a Parent component. 
In such cases the process takes place in a certain order as follows:-

a. The Parent constructor gets called first.
b. Then the Parent render method gets called second. Now there is a child component that is being instantiated inside the parent now the
methods of child components gets called in the same order.
c. The child constructor gets called first(with reference of child) i.e third with reference to the complete process.
d. Then the child render method gets called fourth.

Now, if we use a componentdidmount() method in the class based components then this method gets called at the last i.e after the render is done
and the component is visible on the screen.

So in this case the process order would be:

a. The parent constructor is called 1st
b. The parent render method is called 2nd
c. The child constructor is called 3rd
d. The child render method is called 4th
e. The child component did mount gets called 5th
f. The parent component did mount gets called 6th

componentdidmount() is used to make API calls.
