Let's get hooked:-
React Hooks

.js and .jsx extension can be used interchangebaly and it hardly matters.

we can use this type of import statement import Header from './components/Header' else we can also use import Header from './components/Header.js'
it's debateable on how do we import but we can keep it as it is and not complicate the things by putting the extension.

when we have to export multiple values from a single file then we use Named Export(check constants.js file for that
and if we want to export only single value from a single file at that time we use default export. check components files for the same for example.

Named imports are imported like this import { RESTURANT_IMAGE_CDN_URL } from "../utils/constants"
default import imported like this import ResturantCard from "./ResturantCard";


State variable = Super powerful variable.

REACT HOOK is a normal JS function which is given to us by REACT. THAT function comes with some superpowers.

#REACT HOOKS
- Normal JS utility functions.

- 2 Very important Hooks. 
1. useState() - Super powerful state variables in react
2. useEffect()
