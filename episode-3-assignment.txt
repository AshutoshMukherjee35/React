● Role of type attribute in script tag? What options can I use there?
The `type` attribute in the `<script>` tag specifies the scripting language used in the script. By default, it's `"text/javascript"`, which tells the browser to execute the script as JavaScript.

Here are some options you can use for the `type` attribute:

- `"text/javascript"`: The default, for JavaScript code.
- `"module"`: Indicates that the script should be treated as an ES6 module, enabling import/export features.
- `"application/json"`: Treats the content as JSON data.
- `"application/ld+json"`: For embedding JSON-LD (Linked Data) in web pages.

For most modern web development, using `"module"` is common for modular JavaScript.
