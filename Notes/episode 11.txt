Higher order component is a function that takes a component and returns a component.

HOC takes a component, enhances the component & returns the component


UI layer = JSX
data layer = states, all the things mentioned inside {}

REACT has 1 way data flow. Data flows in 1 direction i.e top to bottom.

Process of passing the data as props from top level component to the lowest level of component is known as props drilling

Supposse we have some data in resturant menu and we need to pass that to itemlist component  so the data is passed 
through a level of components. this concept is known as props drilling.

This is difficult when component composition increases heavily. We should avoid props drilling as it gets difficult to
manage props in large applications.

Instead we should use React context in place of props drilling

We use context which is like a global place where ur data is kept and anybody can access it
