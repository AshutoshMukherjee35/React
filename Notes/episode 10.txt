tailwind css


Postcss is a tool to transform css into JS. Tailwind css uses it.

npx means we are invoking/inititalizing tailwind css into our repository. 
npx tailwindcss init this command creates tailwind.config.js file

parcel will use .postcssrc to understand tailwind. that is why we use all configuration written in .postcssrc

in tailwind.config.js content: [
    "./src/**/*.{html,js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ], this means tailwind can be found in any of the files mentioned in the content
