Redux works in the data layer of the react app

Project consists of UI layer as well as data layer

Redux is not mandatory

In large scale app where there is too much read and write operations taking place at such times we use Redux
All apps that is made using redux can be made without using Redux

Redux is different from React. Redux is a seperate library.
Redux is not the only library for state management we can also use zustand.

Using redux, our application becomes easy to debug

Redux store is a big object kept in a central place There is no problem in keeping a very big object with all the data

We have parts of redux store with slices

Sepearte slice for cart data
seperate slice for themes
seperate slice for user data


clicking on the add button it dispatches an action which inturn calls a function then the function modifies the cart
