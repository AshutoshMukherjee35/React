food ordering app buildup:-

1st thing that wwe should do is planning.

in the web page we'll have a header. with 

Components:-

1. header
    -logo
    -nav items
2. body
   - Search
   - Resturant Container
     - Resturant cards
        - img , name of res , star rating , cuisines , delivery time
3. footer
    -copyright
    -links
    -address
    -contact info

passing a prop to a component is similar to passing argument to a function.

to pass dynamic data we use props to pass the data.

CONFIG DRIVEN UI:-

UI is basically is driven by a config. Latest practice this is what every company follows now. Asked in UI system design interview

swiggy api: https://www.swiggy.com/dapi/restaurants/list/v5?lat=12.89960&lng=80.22090&is-seo-homepage-enabled=true&page_type=DESKTOP_WEB_LISTING

resList.map(resturant => <ResturantCard key={resturant.info.id} resData={resturant}/>) 
writing key is important because if we won't it will throw an error as react uniquely does not identify new elements added

we don't use index as key's in react as it is a bad practice. This is mentioned in the official documentation of React.
